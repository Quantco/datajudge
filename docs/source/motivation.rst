Why not Great Expectations?
-------------------------------

The major selling point is to be able to conveniently express expectations _between_ different ``DataSource``s. Great Expectations, in contrast, focuses on expectations against single ``DataSource``s.

Over time, we have found some people find the following aspects of ``datajudge`` useful
- Lots of the 'query writing' is off-loaded to the library by having tailored ``Constraint``s
- Easier/faster onboarding than with Great Expectations
- Assertion messages with counterexamples and other context information, speeding up the data debugging process
